<p>This page documents a part of the Hapy parser API that is useful for
handling a stream of communication protocol messages, interactive user
interfaces, or similar input where things to be parsed do not have
known-a-priory boundaries and/or are surrounded by opaque data such as message
payload.</p>

<a name="sect-challenge"></a><h2>The Challenge</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>When parsing communication protocol messages or handling an interactive
user interface, message boundaries are often unknown and several messages
(commands, etc.) may be present in the already available input. These
conditions require the programmar to distinguish among the following three
cases:</p>

<ol>

	<li><p><span class="concept">Input starts with a complete message
	possibly followed by something else.</span> The message needs to be
	interpreted, freeing buffers for more input. This is a common
	situation when message headers are followed by message body; the body
	is treated as opaque data or has syntax different from the headers. It
	is often large and/or has header-dependent length.</p></li>

	<li><p><span class="concept">Input starts with a valid message prefix
	and contains nothing else.</span> If input buffers are full, terminate
	processing with a "message too big to handle" error. Otherwise, keep
	buffering (i.e., wait for more input) in hope to get a complete
	message. This is a common case when input data trickles in over a
	slow network link or from a typing human.</p></li>

	<li><p><span class="concept">Input contains something other than the
	above.</span> Terminate processing with a "invalid message syntax"
	error. This is a common situation when communicating with humans and
	broken or malicious agents.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>The usual parser interface that yields a yes/no answer for a given input is
useless in all three cases: it can only work if the input contains a single
complete message and nothing else. A parser that can distinguish the first
case only will be more susceptible to even trivial denial of service attacks
(intentional or not) since it would have to rely on timeouts to detect invalid
input.</p>

<p>A Hapy parser can distinguish all three cases. It does not assume that the
end of currently available input is the end of the thing being parsed, and it
uses a three-way logic (miss/match/need-more-data). These and other features
allow Hapy parsers to detect valid message prefixes, including complete valid
messages, and distinguish them from garbage.</p>

<a name="sect-calci"></a><h2>Interactive Calculator Example</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>Since providing a simple but realistic and testable example for parsing
protocol messages is difficult, we settle on an interactive calculator example
(<a href="calci.cc">doc/calci.cc</a>). For a non-interactive version of a very
similar calculator (<a href="calc.cc">doc/calc.cc</a>), refer to the <a
href="primer.html">Primer</a>. If you are new to Hapy, you should read the <a
href="primer.html">Primer</a> first.</p>

<p>Our interactive calculator parses and interprets arithmetic expressions as
they are being entered by the user. The calculator reads standard input
stream, one character at a time, updates parser state, and prints expression
values when input contains a complete expression. Invalid input is also
detected as soon as possible. Invalid input terminates the program.</p>

<a name="sect-calci-grammar"></a><h3>Grammar</h3>

<div class="sect">

	<p>The grammar for dynamic interactive parsing is the same as its
	static version except for two little but important differences.
	First, we concentrate on a single expression in a possibly infinite
	stream of expressions instead of expecting to parse a terminated
	sequence of expressions. Thus, our top-most start rule is
	a single rExpression:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	// was: rGrammar = +(rExpression >> ';');
	rGrammar = rExpression >> ';';
	...

	</pre>

	<p>Second, we do not want to wait for the next expression to interpret
	the previous one. This implies that our grammar must not trim
	whitespace after the semicolon, or we would have to wait for that
	whitespace to terminate (with the start of the next expression or with
	the final end of input). Thus, instead of specifying the trim
	rule starting with rGrammar, we trim starting with rExpression
	only.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	// was: rGrammar.trim(*space_r);
	rExpression.trim(*space_r);
	...
	</pre>

	<p>The above trimming rule takes care of whitespace <em>between</em>
	expressions via the left-side trim of rExpression.  However, note that
	the rule does not trim any whitespace that <em>follows</em> the very
	last semicolon.  Thus, the grammar does not allow any trailing
	garbage.  The grammar or parsing loop could be slightly modified to
	accommodate for the latter case if needed.</p>

	<p>The rest of the grammar is the same for <a
	href="calc.cc">doc/calc.cc</a> and <a href="calci.cc">doc/calci.cc</a>.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-calci-loop"></a><h3>Processing Loop</h3>

<div class="sect">

	<p>The static calculator was able to build the parsing tree and
	initiate interpretation in a just a few statements:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	// abridged static code only; see below for calci code
	if (parser.parse(input)) 
		interpret(parser.result().pree);
	</pre>


	<p>The interactive calculator has to use prefix parsing interface. We
	no longer can separate parsing and interpretation stages in time. By
	the very nature of the problem, they become interleaved. The
	if-statement in the above static code is replaced by a loop:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	do {
		parser.moveOn();
		if (parser.begin()) {
			while (parser.step())
				getData(parser);
		}
		parser.end();
	} while (interpret(parser.result()));
	</pre>

	<p>The code inside the loop starts by reseting the parser before each
	new expression is parsed. We could simply create a new parser instead,
	but that would mean "compiling" and optimizing the same grammar on
	every loop iteration. The moveOn() method allows to perform expensive
	initialization of the parser just once, during the very first call to
	the begin() method.</p>

	<p>The inner while-loop attempts to get more input data while more
	data is needed after parsing available input. The step() method always
	attempts to continue parsing available input and is guaranteed to
	return true if and only if more data is needed to parse the input. The
	latter implies that once the final end of input is reached and
	signaled to the parser, the step() method returns false regardless of
	the input and parsing success. Thus, the loop terminates once we found
	the first valid or corrupted message. The getData() function is
	discussed below.</p>

	<p>The getData() function attempts to read more user input,
	one character at a time. If the final end is reached, the
	parser is notified and no more attempts to read input are
	made.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	// supply parser with more input
	void getData(Parser &amp;parser) {
		if (!parser.sawDataEnd()) {
			char c;
			if (cin.get(c))
				parser.pushData(string(1, c));
			else
				parser.sawDataEnd(true);
		}
	}
	</pre>

	<p>The do-loop ends each iteration with a cleanup call to the end()
	method, followed by the call to the interpret() function. The latter
	returns true if the parser successfully parsed a complete expression.
	Otherwise, it complaints of a syntax error (unless the input was
	empty) and returns false.</p>
	
	<pre class="codesample">
	bool interpret(const Result &amp;result) {
		if (result.statusCode == Result::scMatch) {
			intrpTop(result.pree);
			return true;
		}

		// if empty input did not parse, that is OK; just stop
		if (result.input.size() > 0)
			cerr &lt;&lt; result.location() &lt;&lt; ": syntax error" &lt;&lt; endl;
		return false;
	}
	</pre>

	<p>The rest of the iterative calculator code is identical to the
	static calculator discussed in <a href="primer.html">Primer</a>.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-calci-session"></a><h3>Sample Session</h3>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Here is a sample interactive session with calci. Note how
	whitespace after semicolon is printed as a part of the 
	<em>next</em> expression.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	1;
	1 = 1
	2;

	2 = 2
	1+1;

	1+1 = 2
	1+
	3+
	4+0
	;

	1+
	3+
	4+0
	 = 8


	1+1;


	1+1 = 2
	</pre>

	<p>Terminating our interactive session requires typing the end-of-file
	character (Control-D on many systems) immediately after an expression,
	to avoid trailing whitespace. We will use the echo command instead. In
	the following examples, the "-n" parameter is used to avoid the
	default new line at the end of the echo output.</p>
	
	<pre class="codesample">
	% echo "1+1;" | ./calc   # note calc, not calci
	1+1 = 2
	% echo "1+1;" | ./calci
	1+1 = 2
	near the end of input: syntax error
	% echo -n "1+1;" | ./calci
	1+1 = 2
	% echo -n "1+1;1+2+(3);" | ./calci
	1+1 = 2
	1+2+(3) = 6
	</pre>
</div>

</div>

<a name="sect-vs-simple"></a><h2>Simple Versus Prefix Parsing</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>Prefix parsing is a more general interface compared to the simple parsing
interface discussed in <a href="primer.html">Primer</a>. The simple parse()
method can and is implemented using the prefix parsing interface. A slightly
abridged version of the parse() method implementation is shown below.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	bool Hapy::Parser::parse(const string &content) {
		pushData(content);
		sawDataEnd(true);
		begin();
		end();
		return result().statusCode == Result::scMatch;
	}
	</pre>

<p>Since parse() calls sawDataEnd(true) first, the begin() method is
guaranteed to return false.  Thus, there is no reason to call step() before
calling end(). The actual parse() method also ensures that the end of
the input has been reached for successful matches.</p>
