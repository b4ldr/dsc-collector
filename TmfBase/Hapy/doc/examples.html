<p>Below are a few examples for the Hapy grammar specification interface. A
quick-start <a href="primer.html">instructions</a> and a BNF-to-Hapy
conversion <a href="syntax.html">table</a> are available elsewhere.</p>

<div class="ex">

	<div class="heading">

		<span class="tag">Example</span>: A simple value grammar -- value is a
		number, string, or name.

	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">EBNF</p>

		<pre class="main-body">value     = number | qw_string | name;
number    = DIGIT DIGIT*;
qw_string = '"' (CHARACTER - '"')* '"';
name      = ALPHA (ALPHA | DIGIT | '_')*;</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">Hapy</p>

		<pre class="main-body">value      = number | qw_string | name;
number     = digit_r >> *digit_r;
qw_string  = quoted_r(anychar_r);
name       = alpha_r >> *(alpha_r | digit_r | '_');</pre>

	<div class="trailer">

		<p><span class="tag">Comments</span>: Hapy expressions
		approximate EBNF syntax rather well while remaining compliant
		and portable C++ statements.  The most obvious difference is
		the use of the shift operator (">>") to concatenate grammar
		symbols. The repetition symbol ("*" a.k.a. <a
		href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star">Kleene
		star</a>) is placed in front of the expression rather
		than at the back.</p>
	
		<p>The Hapy quoted string rule uses <a
		href="builtins.html">quoted_r</a> function to
		improve readability but that function internal implementation
		matches the EBNF definition.</p>

	</div>

</div>

<p>Here is an example illustrating both why one would want a backtracking
parser (to handle arithmetic and other not-immediately-deterministic
expressions), and how Hapy makes building such a parser simple by
automatically handling unbounded left recursion so typical in simple
expression grammars.</p>

<div class="ex">

	<div class="heading">
		<span class="tag">Example</span>: Recursive expressions.
	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">EBNF</p>

		<pre class="main-body">expression = expression '+' expression |
             '(' expression ')' |
             value;</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">Hapy</p>

		<pre class="main-body">expression = expression >> '+' >> expression |
             '(' >> expression >> ')' |
             value;</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="trailer">

		<p><span class="tag">Comments</span>: The importance of this example
		is that the programmar is not required to eliminate left recursion
		from EBNF. While such manual elimination is simple in this example,
		real-world cases may require a lot of energy. Many generated parsers
		would simply enter an infinite loop, crash or dump core, and not even
		warn the programmar that left recursion exists.</p>
	
		<p>Hapy parsers handle left recursion by detecting
		absence of parsing progress and looking for other matching
		rules instead.</p>

	</div>

</div>

<p>The Needle In Haystack example below detects the presence of a well-formed
content in the noise of surrounding opaque data, illustrating the power of
full backtracking support. This example may seem rather artificial, but is
actually "based on a true story"!</p>

<div class="ex">

	<div class="heading">
		<span class="tag">Example</span>: Needle In Haystack.
	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">EBNF</p>

		<pre class="main-body">grammar = CHARACTER* needle.
needle = ALPHA '=' DIGIT.</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="main">

		<p class="tag">Hapy</p>

		<pre class="main-body">rGrammar = *anychar_r >> rNeedle;
rNeedle = alpha_r >> '=' >> digit_r;</pre>

	</div>

	<div class="trailer">

		<p><span class="tag">Comments</span>: The above grammar is guaranteed
		to find a "needle", although it may take some time to do that for
		<em>large</em> inputs. If the input can be very large and speed is of
		importance, it is usually possible to speed Hapy parsers up by
		providing various optimization hints.  Such optimizations can usually
		be postponed until the core grammar and the interpreter are well
		tested.</p>
	
		<p>The kleene star (*anychar_r) rule is greedy. It will consume all
		input before backtracking in hope to find a matching "needle".</p>
