<a name="sect-intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="sect">
	
	<p>Debugging is necessary when the parser results do not match user
	expectations. The parser may fail to accept valid input, fail to
	reject invalid input, or fail to produce an expected parsing tree. The
	mismatch between user expectations and parser behavior could be due to
	user misunderstanding of Hapy functionality or a Hapy implementation
	bug.</p>

	<p>The following three kinds of information are provided for debugging
	parsing problems:</p>

	<ul>

		<li><p>A rule compilation <a
		href="#sect-interp-comp">trace</a> that reflects conversion of
		the user-specified grammar into a set of ready-to-fire parsing
		rules. The most visible effect of rule compilation is addition
		of trimming rules, which is triggered by the user requesting
		implicit trimming via the <span
		class="codesample">Rule::trim()</span> call. Another visible
		effect is duplication of rules, one copy for each use in the
		grammar. The latter is needed because rules inherit certain
		attributes from their context, and the same rule can be used
		in different contexts within the same grammar (e.g., a
		trimming and a verbatim contexts.</p></li>

		<li><p>Parsing <a href="#sect-interp-parse">trace</a> shows
		which rules are executed, what their execution result is, and
		how the input buffer changes as rules match or
		backtrack.</p></li>

		<li><p>Parsing tree <a href="#sect-interp-pree">dump</a>
		shows the structure of the parsing tree.</p></li>

	</ul>

</div>

<a name="sect-enable"></a><h2>Enabling</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>By default, Hapy debugging is not enabled. Debugging mode can be turned on
from within the program or by using an environmental variable. When
debugging is on, a rule compilation <a href="#sect-interp-comp">trace</a> and
a parsing <a href="#sect-interp-parse">trace</a> are produced if
applicable.</p>

<p>To enable Hapy debugging from the program, call <span
class="codesample">Hapy::Debug(true)</span>, which is a static method of the
<span class="codesample">Rule</span> class.  To disable debugging, call <span
class="codesample">Hapy::Debug(false)</span>.  Using this approach, debugging
can be turned on or off many times, at any time.</p>

<p>It is also possible to enable debugging using the <span
class="codesample">HAPY_DEBUG</span> environment variable: Set <span
class="codesample">HAPY_DEBUG</span> to <span class="codesample">USER</span>
to enable debugging and to <span class="codesample">NONE</span> to disable it.
Other modes may be added in the future.</p>

<p>Explicit debugging instructions in the program (if any) overwrite
environmental settings. If you do not want your program to react on the <span
class="codesample">HAPY_DEBUG</span> environment variable setting, call <span
class="codesample">Hapy::Debug(false)</span> before using Hapy objects.</p>

<p>All debugging info is dumped to <span
class="codesample">std::clog</span>.</p>

<p>To <a href="#sect-interp-pree">dump</a> a parsing tree, call the <span
class="codesample">Pree::print(ostream &amp;)</span> method of the tree. Parsing
tree nodes can be dumped many times, at any time.</p>


</div>

<a name="sect-annotate"></a><h2>Annotating Rules</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Internally, Hapy parser assigns rules unique identifiers.  While
	those identifiers can be used to grok rule compilation and
	application traces, it is often much easier for humans to refer to
	rules using user-provided names. To name a parsing rule, use the <span
	class="codesample">Rule(const string &amp;name, RuleId *)</span>
	constructor. For example,</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	using namespace Hapy;

	Rule rGrammar("grammar", 0);
	Rule rExpression("expression", 0);
	...
	rGrammar = *(rExpression >> ';');
	...
	</pre>

	<p>As the above example illustrates, you can set the second parameter
	to null if you are not interested in knowing the rule identifier
	(which is dynamically assigned to the rule at construction time).  You
	can always retrieve that identifier later, using the <span
	class="codesample">Hapy::id()</span> method.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-interp"></a><h2>Interpreting Output</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>This section explains how to grok debugging output produced
	by Hapy rules and parsing tree nodes.</p>


	<a name="sect-interp-comp"></a><h3>Rule Compilation Trace</h3>

	<div class="sect">

	<p>When the <span class="codesample">Parser::parse()</span> method or
	equivalent is called the first time, each rule in the supplied grammar
	is "compiled" to accommodate various user settings (e.g., trimming) and
	to optimize future parsing. If debugging is <a
	href="#sect-enable">enabled</a>, then each compiled rule is printed on
	the standard error stream (<span
	class="codesample">std::clog</span>).</p>

	<p>For example, here is the rule compilation trace produced by the
	calculator grammar (see <a href="calc.cc"><span
	class="filename">docs/calc.cc</span></a>):</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
compiled rule:  _white#r-105 = white
compiled rule:  r-123 = *_white#r-105
compiled rule:  _digit#r-103 = digit
compiled rule:  _digit#r-103 = digit
compiled rule:  r-121 = *_digit#r-103
compiled rule:  r102 = _digit#r-103 >> r-121
...
compiled rule:  _;_trimmer#r108 = r-123 >> _;#r-109 >> r-123
compiled rule:  r-110 = r101 >> _;_trimmer#r108
compiled rule:  r103 = +r-110
	</pre>

	<p>The <span class="codesample">rDDD</span> and <span
	class="codesample">r-DDD</span> labels after the '#' sign are rule
	identifiers that Hapy assigned to the rule (e.g., <span
	class="codesample">r-105</span>. Negative IDs correspond to
	intermediate rules. Positive IDs correspond to rules explicitly
	declared by the user.</p>

	<p>The labels in front of the '#' sign are rule names automatically
	assigned by Hapy to some simple built-in rules. Most rules will not
	have these by default because Hapy cannot guess an appropriate name.
	To improve the readability of the trace, you should <a
	href="#sect-annotate">name</a> rules. For example, if calculator rules
	are named to match their variable names, the compilation trace
	reveals these user-defined rules (among the same of intermediate rules
	with negative IDs):</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
compiled rule:  number#r102 = _digit#r-103 >> r-121
compiled rule:  number_trimmer#r104 = r-123 >> number#r102 >> r-123
compiled rule:  expression#r101 = number_trimmer#r104 | r-118 | r-114
compiled rule:  expression#r101 = number_trimmer#r104 | r-118 | r-114
compiled rule:  expression#r101 = number_trimmer#r104 | r-118 | r-114
compiled rule:  expression#r101 = number_trimmer#r104 | r-118 | r-114
compiled rule:  grammar#r103 = +r-110
	</pre>

	<p>This is still not perfect and even not pretty, of course.
	Improvement suggestions are welcome.</p>

	<p>Some rules (e.g., <span class="codesample">expression#r101</span>
	above) are repeated because they are cloned during the compilation
	process and each clone is compiled. Cloning is necessary when the same
	rule can be reached by different paths from the start rule of the
	grammar <em>and</em> those paths have different user-preferences such
	as trimming. At the time of writing, Hapy does not try to minimize the
	number of clones.</p>

	<p>The compilation trace is often essential for understanding the <a
	href="#sect-interp-parse">parsing trace</a> because it maps rule IDs
	to rule definitions and because it shows auto-generated trimming
	rules.</p>

	</div>

	<a name="sect-interp-parse"></a><h3>Parsing Trace</h3>

	<div class="sect">

	<p>The parsing trace shows parsing progress. Each time a rule is tried
	it is printed with a "try" label and the indentation level is
	increased.  Each time the rule returns, the indentation level is
	decreased and the rule execution result is printed with a "match",
	"miss", "error", or "more" label.</p>

	<p>Buffer contents or its prefix is printed after the "buf:" label,
	with the total buffer content length printed after the "clen:" label.
	The buffer is rendered so that it always appears on one line, with
	non-printable characters escaped using C++ character escaping
	conventions.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
1/1-  try: grammar#r103::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
2/2-    try: r-110::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
3/3-      try: expression#r101::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
4/4-        try: number_trimmer#r104::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
5/5-          try: r-123::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
6/6-            try: _white#r-105::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
6/6-            miss: _white#r-105 buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
5/5-          match: r-123 buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
7/5-          try: number#r102::firstMatch buf: 1+1;\n clen:5
...
7/5-          match: number#r102 buf: +1;\n clen:4
11/5-          try: r-123::firstMatch buf: +1;\n clen:4
12/6-            try: _white#r-105::firstMatch buf: +1;\n clen:4
12/6-            miss: _white#r-105 buf: +1;\n clen:4
11/5-          match: r-123 buf: +1;\n clen:4
4/4-        match: number_trimmer#r104 buf: +1;\n clen:4
3/3-      match: expression#r101 buf: +1;\n clen:4
...
1/1-  match: grammar#r103 buf:  clen:0
	</pre>

	<p>The first trace column contains two numbers separated by a slash:
	the rule invocation identifier and the nesting level. The rule
	invocation identifier increases with every "try" statement. Searching
	for the same invocation identifier links the "try" statement with the
	corresponding rule execution result. For example, to find how the
	first <span class="codesample">expression</span> rule matched, one
	could search for a "^3/" pattern.

	<p>Searching for a given nesting level allows to skip details at lower
	levels.</p>

	</div>

	<a name="sect-interp-pree"></a><h3>Parsing Tree Dump</h3>

	<div class="sect">

	<p>For each parsing tree node, Hapy dumps the corresponding rule
	identifier (see the "Parsing trace" <a
	href="#sect-interp-parse">Section</a> for details). For non-leaf
	nodes, the number of kids or subtrees is printed in parathesis.  The
	line ends with the node image prefix (escaped as discussed in the
	"Parsing trace" <a href="#sect-interp-parse">Section</a>). Kids, if
	any, are dumped on the next line(s) with increased indentation.</p>

	<p>Here is a complete parsing tree produced by the <a
	href="calc.cc"><span class="filename">docs/calc.cc</span></a> grammar
	and <span class="codesample">"1+1;"</span> input.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
grammar#r103(1): 1+1;\n
  r-110(2): 1+1;\n
    expression#r101(1): 1+1
      r-114(3): 1+1
        expression#r101(1): 1
          number#r102: 1
        _+#r-112: +
        expression#r101(1): 1
          number#r102: 1
    _;#r-109: ;
	</pre>

	<p>Parsing tree nodes produced by implicit trimming rules are not
	shown and are not visible when traversing the parsing tree with
	user-level interfaces.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<a name="sect-context"></a><h2>Context-sensitive Debugging</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Using Actions, it is simple to enable and/or disable debugging
	depending on what rules are being tried. For example, the following
	code enables debugging when a particular rule has matched:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	using namespace Hapy;

	static
	void TurnDebuggingOn(Action::Params *) {
		Debug(true);
	}
	...

	Rule particular;
	particular = ...;
	particular.ptr_action(&amp;TurnDebuggingOn);
	</pre>

	<p>Please see the <a href="actions.html">Actions</a> page for a
	discussion and more examples.</p>
