<p>Hapy parser is a C++ object capable of producing a <a
href="pree.html">parsing tree</a> (a Pree object) based on the given grammar
and input data. This page documents public methods of the Parser class. Please
see <a href="primer.html">Primer</a> and <a href="prefix.html">Prefix
Parsing</a> documents (in that order) for typical Parser API usage.</p>

		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">void <span class="concept">grammar</span>(const Rule &amp;start)</td>

			<td class="semantics">Specifies the grammar for the parser to use.
			The start rule is remembered but the grammar is not checked or
			optimized until the begin() method is called.</td>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">parse</span>(const string &amp;content)</td>

			<td class="semantics">Parsers supplied string and returns true iff
			the entire string has matched the grammar. The parsing tree is
			stored in result().pree.  The method assumes that the supplied
			content corresponds to the entire available input data. That is,
			it calls sawDataEnd(true) internally.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">const Result &amp;<span class="concept">result</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Returns result structure containing the
			result status code and parsing tree. The structure is set only
			when the method end() or parse() is called.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">nextMatch</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Returns true iff the same input can be
			parsed differently using the same grammar, implying grammar
			ambiguities. Note that ambiguity detection is implemented via
			standard Hapy backtracking mechanism and can be at least as
			"expensive" (e.g., slow and memory consuming) as finding the first
			match. The method updates result structure just like the parse()
			method does. This method must not be called unless a match was
			found during the last parse(), begin-step-end, or nextMatch()
			call.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">begin</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Checks and optimizes the grammar if that has
			not been done before. Returns false if the grammar is invalid.
			Parses already available data (which could be empty at the time).
			Returns true iff more data is expected and needed to declare
			(distinguish) a miss, match, or an error outcome. This method
			must be called before step() or end().</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">step</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Resumes parsing, presumably after more
			information has been made available after the call to begin().
			Returns true iff more data is expected and needed to declare
			(distinguish) a miss, match, or an error outcome. This method must
			be called after successful begin() or step() calls and before
			end(). Thus, it may be called multiple times.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">end</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Terminates parsing algorithm and determines
			the final result if that has not happened earlier. Always returns
			false (because more data is not expected after the call to end()).
			This method must be called after all begin() and step()
			calls.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">void <span class="concept">moveOn</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Adjusts internal parser state so that
			begin-step-end sequence can be repeated again, for the remaining
			(unparsed) portion of the data, without recompiling the grammar
			and without re-supplying end-of-data information.  This method
			must be called before repeated calls to begin() and may be called
			before the very first call to begin().</td>

		</tr>
		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">void <span class="concept">pushData</span>(const string &amp;newData)</td>

			<td class="semantics">Adds data to the parser buffer. This method
			may be called at any time.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">hasData</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Returns true iff the parser's buffer
			contains unparsed data.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr class="even">

			<td class="profile">bool <span class="concept">sawDataEnd</span>()</td>

			<td class="semantics">Returns true iff sawDataEnd(true) has
			already been called.</td>

		</tr>

		<tr class="odd">

			<td class="profile">void <span class="concept">sawDataEnd</span>(bool did)</td>

			<td class="semantics">With a true argument, instructs the parser
			to assume that no more data is coming. The methods begin() and
			step() are guaranteed to return false after a sawDataEnd(true)
			call has been made.</td>

	<p>The parsing tree interface is likely to evolve with time. For
	example, adding rule-specific node data may be needed.</p>
