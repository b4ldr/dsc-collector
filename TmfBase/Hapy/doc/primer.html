<a name="sect-big"></a><h2>The big picture</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>We are going to build a Hapy parser for a simple grammar and use it to
interpret program input. The complete corresponding C++ code is available as
<a href="calc.cc">doc/calc.cc</a> in your Hapy source code distribution.</p>

<p>Hapy parsing usually involves these major steps:</p>

<ol>

	<li>locating an existing grammar or writing one from scratch (often in
	a BNF-like form),</li>

	<li><a href="#sect-grammar">specifying</a> a grammar for the parser
	generator,</li>

	<li><a href="#sect-parser">parsing</a> input with a generated parser,
	and</li>

	<li><a href="#sect-results">interpreting</a> parsing results,
	including errors.</li>

</ol> 

<p>The first step is out of Hapy scope (let's assume that you have a
ready-to-use grammar or can write one from scratch). Hapy is meant to make the
second and third steps a snap. As for the last step (interpretation), Hapy
parsers produce parsing trees that are easy to search, traverse, or extract
values from, leaving interpretation logic to the programmer.</p>

<p>The sections below explain these steps in more detail.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-grammar"></a><h2>Specifying a grammar</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<a name="sect-grammar-bnf"></a><h3>BNF conversion</h3>

	<p>Let's assume you have the following BNF-like grammar, involving
	recursion and multiple rules for a single non-terminal:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		expression = number | '(' expression ')' .
		expression = expression '+' expression .
		number     = DIGIT DIGIT* .
	</pre>

	<p>Convert the grammar to C++ code. First, for each <em>unique</em>
	non-terminal (the symbol on the left hand side of each rule), define a
	Hapy rule variable:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		Rule rExpression;
		Rule rNumber;
	</pre>

	<p>The Rule class constructor automatically assigns a unique
	identifier to each rule. That ID is often essential for interpreting
	parsing trees. It can be extracted using Rule's id() method. The order
	of Rule construction is not important.</p>

	<p>Now, convert BNF rules to C++ rules using BNF-to-Hapy conversion table
	provided <a href="syntax.html">elsewhere</a>. Merge multiple BNF rules
	with the same left-hand-side non-terminal (if any) using C++ "bitwise or"
	operator:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		rExpression = rNumber | '(' >> rExpression >> ')' |
			      rExpression >> '+' >> rExpression;
		rNumber = digit_r >> *digit_r;
	</pre>
	
	<p>You are done converting your BNF to Hapy rules. Note how C++ "right
	shift" operator is used to concatenate rule components. Also note that
	each Hapy Rule object got exactly one assignment operator, defining the
	corresponding parsing rule. The BNF-to-Hapy conversion merged multiple
	"expression" definitions in BNF into one C++ assignment. The order of
	assignments is not important.</p>

	<p>Let's add a tiny bit of realism to our example. The rExpression grammar
	specifies a single valid expression. In reality, a valid input probably
	can have one or more expressions:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		Rule rGrammar;
		rGrammar = +(rExpression >> ';');
	</pre>

	<p>The above addition specifies that a valid input must contain at least
	one expression and expressions are delimited using semicolons.</p>

	<a name="sect-grammar-space"></a><h3>Whitespace handling rules</h3>

	<p>Some grammars have explicit built-in rules to handle whitespace,
	comments, and such. If your grammar is like that, you can skip this
	section.</p>

	<p>Most grammars, however, have a prose statement saying that every
	grammar token or terminal can be surrounded by any amount of whitespace.
	While you can always express such a statement using explicit grammar
	rules, the resulting noise makes the grammar unreadable. A better approach
	is to tell Hapy to trim whitespace automagically:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		rGrammar.trim(*space_r);
		rNumber.verbatim(true);
	</pre>

	<p>The R.trim() method specifies the default "whitespace trimming" rule
	for rule R and all rules R uses. By default, trimming rule propagates all
	the way down to grammar terminals (e.g., string constants or character
	class rules like digit_r), surrounding each terminal by a copy of the
	specified trimming rule. However, rules marked as verbatim do not
	propagate trimming to their subrules. We marked rNumber as a verbatim rule
	because numbers should not have spaces inside them (e.g., "1 2 + 3 4" is
	not a valid expression in our grammar).</p>

	<p>The "whitespace" rule can be anything, of course. We used *space_r as a
	typical example. Note that specifying just space_r would require a single
	whitespace character as a terminal separator, making expressions like
	"(3)" or "1 + 2" invalid. Sometimes, that is exactly what you want!</p>

	<p>Rules like rNumber are really terminals from high-level grammar and
	interpretation points of view: they do not have internal whitespaces, and
	you are unlikely to be interested in their character-level
	decomposition. It is a good idea to mark such nodes as "leaf" nodes:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		rNumber.leaf(true);
	</pre>


	<a name="sect-grammar-speed"></a><h3>Optimizing parsing speed</h3>

	<p>The last, and often optional, step is to optimize your grammar for
	parsing speed and memory usage by inserting "commit points". By
	default, a Hapy parser always tries all alternatives specified by the
	grammar. In most cases, that is exactly what you want from the
	correctness point of view. However, it may take a long time for the
	parser to try all alternatives in complicated rules, especially when
	dealing with invalid input.</p>

	<p>If you mark a rule as a commit point, the rule will never
	backtrack.  That is, once the committed rule finds the first match,
	the rule will optimize the corresponding part of the parsing tree and
	will not try to find other matches, even if all other rules fail
	because of that.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		rGrammar.committed(true);
		rNumber.committed(true);
	</pre>

	<p>Committing the top rule (rGrammar) gives Hapy parser a chance to
	optimize the entire parsing tree once parsing is completed. However,
	it prevents you from finding other alternatives with <a
	href="parser.html">Parser</a>::nextMatch() if your grammar is
	ambiguous.</p>

	<p>Use this optimization with care! If you add too many commit points, you
	may disable backtracking where it is essential. As a rule of thumb, it is
	usually safe to commit a rule without subrule repetition or or-ed
	subrules. It is often safe to commit a rule terminated by a relatively
	unique expression (once that expression is parsed, it is unlikely that a
	different alternative would match). For example, if we had isolated the
	(rExpression >> ";") rule into an explicit Rule object, we could commit
	that rule.</p>

	<p>N.B. It is also possible to use commit points to remove grammar
	ambiguities.</p>
	
</div>


<a name="sect-parser"></a><h2>Parsing</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>With the previous step behind us, we are ready to generate a parser and
	parse input using our grammar:

	<pre class="codesample">

		Parser parser;
		parser.grammar(rGrammar);
		if (!parser.parse(content)) {
			cerr &lt;&lt; parser.result().location() &lt;&lt; ": syntax error" &lt;&lt; endl;
			exit(2);
		}
		//parser.result().pree.print(cout &lt;&lt; "success; parsing tree:" &lt;&lt; endl);

		interpret(parser.result().pree);
	</pre>

	<p>The above code fragment assumes that the input has been assigned to a
	string called "content". The Parser::parse() method returns false if there
	is not match or if there were errors interpreting the grammar itself. The
	current error reporting code is ugly and related interface will be improved
	in future Hapy releases. The existing approach is OK to start with.</p>

	<p>The commented out C++ line at the end of the code fragment prints
	the parsing tree. It's handy for debugging. The last line calls
	the interpreter code described below.</p>

	<p>At this point, we have a working parser and can detect valid input.
	If your job is to build a document validator, you are done. Otherwise,
	the next section illustrates parsing tree interpretation
	techniques.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-results"></a><h2>Results interpretation</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>A Hapy parser produces a parsing tree (called "pree" in Hapy code).
	Interpretation involves traversing that tree and/or searching for
	particular nodes on that tree.  Tree node interface is documented <a
	href="pree.html">elsewhere</a>.</p>

	<p>Let's see how we can compute and print the value of every input
	expression using the parsing tree. Let's start with traversing the tree to
	find and print top-level expressions (those delimited by semicolons). We
	will implement expression value computation later.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		// extract top-level expressions (magical version)
		void interpret(const Pree &amp;result) {
			for_some(result, rExpression.id(), ptr_fun(&amp;intrpTop));
		}

		// interpret and report a single top-level expression
		void intrpTop(const Pree &amp;top) {
			const int value = intrpExpr(expr);
			cout &lt;&lt; expr.image() &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
		}
	</pre>

	<p>If the interpret() code looks to cryptic, read on: The for_some()
	function does the left-to-right depth-first traversal of the parsing tree
	and calls the specified function for each node that was produced by a rule
	with the specified ID. Note that for_some() does not go deeper if a match
	is found.  Thus, only top-level expressions will match.</p>

	<p>The intrpTop() function extracts the expression, evaluates it using
	yet unspecified intrpExpr() function, and prints expression image and
	interpreted value.</p>

	<p>We could have avoided the for_some() magic in interpret() by manually
	locating and iterating top-level expressions: We know that a plus rule in
	rGrammar, +(rExpression >> ";"), yields a single parsing tree node, with
	one child for every subrule match.  Children are accumulated in an STL
	container, with the usual begin() and end() iterators. The interpretToo()
	function below iterates through those children using STL's standard
	for_each() call. It calls the same intrpTop() for every child.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		// extract top-level expressions (less magical version)
		void interpretToo(const Pree &amp;result) {
			// rGrammar = +(rExpression >> ";");
			const Pree &amp;topExs = result[0];
			for_each(topExs.begin(), topExs.end(), ptr_fun(&amp;intrpTop));
		}
	</pre>

	<p>Interpreting an expression is relatively straight forward.
	The recursive intrpExpr() function does the job by distinguishing
	three possible cases:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		// calculate expression value
		int intrpExpr(const Pree &amp;expr) {
			// rExpression = rNumber | parens | sum
			const Pree &amp;alt = expr[0];
			if (alt.rid() == rNumber.id()) // rNumber
				return intrpNumber(alt);
			else
			if (alt[0].image() == "(") // parens
				return intrpExpr(alt[1]);
			else // sum
				return intrpExpr(alt[0]) + intrpExpr(alt[2]);
		}
	</pre>

	<p>Interpreting the number node is trivial provided you do not need
	to check for overflows and such:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		// extract top-level expressions (less magical version)
		int intrpNumber(const Pree &amp;num) {
			return atoi(num.image().c_str());
		}
	</pre>

	<p>This is it. We are now ready to calculate a few expressions.  The
	source code of the example can be found in the <a
	href="calc.cc">doc/calc.cc</a> file in the Hapy distribution.
	It is built automatically (but not installed) when you build Hapy.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">

		% echo '1;' | doc/calc
		  1 = 1
		% echo '1+1;' | doc/calc
		  1+1 = 2
		% echo '1+(1);' | doc/calc
		  1+(1) = 2
		% echo '1+1;2+3;' | doc/calc
		  1+1 = 2
		  2+3 = 5
		% echo '1+;' | doc/calc
		  parsing failure after 2 bytes, near ;
	</pre>
