<a name="sect-intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<div class="sect">

<p>Action is a piece of code that can be attached to a grammar rule. The Hapy
parser executes the attached Action right after the rule matches.  Note that a
single rule may match many times during the parsing process and a local match
may be rejected by further rule matching and backtracking. The action is
executed <em>every</em> time the corresponding rule matches.</p>

<p>An action is passed the parsing subtree formed by the match, the result
status code, and other housekeeping information. An action may:</p>

<ul> 

	<li><p>Use the parsing tree in read-only mode. The action may update
	some external (to parser and parsing tree) objects, depending on what
	was matched.</p></li>

	<li><p>Reject the match by changing the result code to <span
	class="codesample">Result::scMiss</span>. This will force the parser
	to look for alternative matches. If no alternative matches can be
	found, then the rule will fail to match, triggering the usual
	backtracking mechanisms. For "committed" rules, the action is executed
	<em>before</em> the result is committed so rule can backtrack if the
	attached action rejects the match.</p></li>

	<li><p>Generate a fatal parsing error by changing the result code to
	<span class="codesample">Result::scError</span>. The error propagates
	upwards the parsing stack, causing the parser to fail. Generating
	errors is useful when the action detects a non-recoverable semantics
	error that makes further parsing useless.</p></li>

	<li><p>Modify the parsing tree and other internal parsing state.
	While technically possible, doing so requires good knowledge of
	internal Hapy mechanisms and is usually not the right thing to
	do.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Under the Hapy hood, an Action is a wrapper around ActionBase, a simple C++
class with a function operator that takes a pointer to <span
class="codesample">Action::Params</span> as a parameter (see <span
class="filename">Action.h</span>). The operator calls a pure virtual <span
class="codesample">act()</span> method. Defining your own actions by
overriding the <span class="codesample">act()</span> method is efficient but
awkward.  The sections below describe two alternative ways to define actions.
Examples source code is also available in Hapy distribution as <a
href="actions.cc"><span class="filename">docs/actions.cc</span></a>.</p>

<a name="sect-attach"></a><h2>Attaching Action to a Rule</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>This section explains how to attach an existing action to a grammar
	rule. For information on how to create an action, see sections <a
	href="#sect-fun">below</a>.</p>

	<p>To enable an action, you must attach it to one of the parsing
	rules. There are two ways to do that. First, an action can be attached
	using a subscript operator[] of the <span
	class="codesample">Rule</span> class:</p>
	
	<pre class="codesample">
	Rule instruction, name, expression, ...;
	instruction = name[&amp;grokName] >> expression[&amp;grokExpression] >> ';';
	name = ...
	expression = ...
	</pre>

	<p>This method keeps semantic actions and syntax rules together, for a
	compact grammar declaration. The subscript operator[] method
	<strong>does not modify its rule</strong>. Thus, the first method can
	be applied to predefined constant rules such as <span
	class="codesample">empty_r</span> and to temporary rules:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	call = empty_r[&prepCall] >> (name >> parameters)[&grokCall];
	</pre>

	<p>The alternative is to use an <span class="codesample">action</span>
	method of the <span class="codesample">Rule</span> class:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	Rule instruction, name, expression, ...;
	instruction = name >> expression >> ';';
	name = ...
	expression = ...

	name.action(&amp;grokName);
	expression.action(&amp;grokExpression);
	</pre>

	<p>This second method allows to isolate semantic actions and syntax
	rules, for a clean, readable grammar. Naturally, the <span
	class="codesample">action</span> method <strong>modifies its
	rule</strong>. Thus, the second method makes it easy to attach the
	same action to all occurrences of the rule in the grammar:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	instruction = name >> expression >> ';';
	call = name >> parameters;
	...
	name.action(&grokName); // will be called for each name above
	</pre>

	<p>The best method to use depends on your grammar, actions, and
	taste. Both methods can be used inside the same grammar.</p>

</div>

<a name="sect-fun"></a><h2>Stand-alone Function Action</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Simple actions can be defined as stand-alone C++ functions. An
	action function takes a pointer to <span
	class="codesample">Action::Params</span> as a parameter and returns
	nothing. The following is an example of an action that turns on
	debugging every time a particular rule matches the input.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	#include &lt;Hapy/Actions.h&gt; /* required header if you do actions */
	...
	using namespace Hapy;

	static
	void TurnDebuggingOn(Action::Params *) {
		Rule::Debug(true);
	}
	...

	Rule particular;
	particular = ...;
	particular.action(&amp;TurnDebuggingOn);
	</pre>

	<p>To pass additional parameters to your action or change its profile, use
	standard STL (e.g., <span class="codesample">bind2nd</span>) or similar
	custom wrappers. For example, lets add a simple "reason" parameter to the
	above <span class="codesample">TurnDebuggingOn()</span> function and call
	the resulting function <span
	class="codesample">ExplainDebuggingOn()</span></p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	#include &lt;Hapy/Actions.h&gt;
	#include &lt;functional&gt;     /* to get access to bind() */
	...

	static
	void ExplainDebuggingOn(Action::Params *, const char *reason) {
		clog << "turning debugging on because " << reason << endl;
		Rule::Debug(true);
	}
	...

	Rule r1, r2;
	...
	r1.action(bind2nd(ptr_fun(&amp;ExplainDebuggingOn), "rule r1 matched!"));
	r2.action(bind2nd(ptr_fun(&amp;ExplainDebuggingOn), "coredump is near"));
	</pre>

	<p>Here is a more realistic example. The following piece of code adds
	a <span class="codesample">Pree</span> tree (corresponding to the
	matched portion of the input) to an STL list. The pointer to the list
	is supplied as an additional action parameter:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	#include &lt;Hapy/Actions.h&gt;
	#include &lt;list&gt;
	...

	typedef std::list&lt;Pree&gt; Matches;

	static
	void AddMatch(Action::Params *p, Matches *matches) {
		matches-&gt;push_back(p-&gt;pree);
	}
	...

	Matches matches;
	Rule particular;
	particular = ...;
	particular.action(bind2nd(ptr_fun(&amp;AddMatch), &matches));
	</pre>

</div>

<a name="sect-method"></a><h2>Class Method Action</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Non-trivial actions are usually implemented as class methods.  A
	class method can be converted to an Action using the <span
	class="codesample">mem_action()</span> function. The function is
	declared in <span class="filename">Hapy/MemAction.h</span> header file
	(which is included by <span class="filename">Hapy/Actions.h</span>).</p>

	<p>The following is an example of a class implementing two actions
	common to configuration file interpretation.  The <span
	class="codesample">Interpreter::handleAssignment()</span> method
	records a value of a user-defined variable.  The <span
	class="codesample">Interpreter::handleOption()</span> method processes
	the configuration option. Each method is associated with the
	corresponding grammar rule via the <span
	class="codesample">Rule::action()</span> call.</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	#include &lt;Hapy/FunAction.h&gt;
	using namespace Hapy;

	class Interpreter {
		public:
			void handleAssignment(Action::Params *params);
			void handleOption(Action::Params *params);
			...
	};
	...

	Interpreter interpreter;
	Rule grammar, statement, assignment, option, ...;
	...
	grammar = *(statement &gt;&gt; ";");
	statement = assignment | option;
	assignment = name &gt;&gt; "=" &gt;&gt; value;
	option = name &gt;&gt; *value;
	...
	assignment.action(mem_action(&amp;interpreter, &amp;Interpreter::handleAssignment));
	option.action(mem_action(&amp;interpreter, &amp;Interpreter::handleOption));
	</pre>

	<p>The <span class="codesample">mem_action()</span> function creates
	an Action object that keeps the pointer to the Interpreter object and
	the pointer to one of the Interpreter's methods. The action method is
	called every time the corresponding rule matches.</p>

	<!-- <p><span class="codesample">Rule</span> class has an <span
	class="codesample">action()</span> method capable of accepting pointers to
	simple stand-alone functions without <span
	class="codesample">ptr_fun()</span> wrapping. Adding a similar
	two-parameter method to accept member actions would require compiler
	support for template-based methods, and some C++ compilers worth
	supporting probably do not support template-based methods.</p> -->

</div>

<a name="sect-preemptive"></a><h2>Preemptive Action</h2>

<div class="sect">

	<p>Hapy actions are always executed after the rule matches.
	Sometimes, it may be useful to execute an action before
	the rule is tried. This is possible by attaching the
	action to a zero-width matching rule:</p>

	<pre class="codesample">
	Rule realCore;  // the actual rule we are interested in
	realCore = ...;

	Rule core; // use "core" instead of the "realCore" rule
	core = empty_r[&amp;PreemptiveAction] &gt;&gt; realCore; 
	</pre>

	<p>When the <span class="codesample">core</span> rule is used instead of
	the <span class="codesample">realCore</span> rule, the <span
	class="codesample">PreemptiveAction()</span> action is executed
	<em>before</em> the <span class="codesample">realCore</span> rule is
	matched.</p>

	<p>If the above tricks end up being used a lot, we can add a <span
	class="codesample">Rule::pre_action()</span> method.</p>
